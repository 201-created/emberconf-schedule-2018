We'll work to prove that switching to TypeScript to build your Ember apps and addons will make them more robust and maintainable, provide a better developer experience, and lead to improved productivity."

But how, you ask?\n\nWe’ll do a technical deep dive into the mechanics of how the ember-service-worker ecosystem utilizes plugins. Along the way we’ll investigate the addon lifecycle and broccoli customizations. Finally we’ll touch on the unique problems of testing such addons."

We'll explore these questions and more to help you build better components."

It makes code more concise, has an elegant API, requests can be canceled if they’re no longer needed, and no more \"isDestroyed\" checks.\n\nLet's do a deep dive into the inner workings of Ember Concurrency. We’ll learn how to build our own abstractions that encapsulate complex tasks for reuse in our apps. We’ll build composable, higher-order tasks that put more power into the hands of you and your fellow developers."
