For many in the enterprise environment, accessibility is a legal requirement. For anyone building a new app *elsewhere*, the user data speaks for itself: nearly 10% of all users have some sort of a disability. So how can we make this easier? What already exists?\n\nNot only will we discuss how Ember supports this, we'll look at some imaging techniques being used in scientific research that may help us look at this challenge from a different angle."

Summing up these findings, we’ll finally try to answer how diversity and growth of this community can be furthered even more in the future."

It’s expensive to create and maintain because the programmer or designer is trying to micromanage the motion. It needs to be hand-tuned for each new feature, device, or media query breakpoint.\n\nThere is an alternative: we can think more like game designers. We can build robust, dynamic systems that animate gracefully, with clear separation between app logic and app motion."

And new interfaces are being explored in Ember Data to allow interop with Orbit.js, which will unlock capabilities such as offline operation, store forking / merging, and more.\n\nThis talk will also touch upon some popular data management solutions in the wider JavaScript ecosystem, both to show how they can be used in Ember applications and to compare and contrast them with Ember’s conventional data stack."

Almost all aspects of my personal history is available through this app.\n\nI’ll go over the history of the Memex, how I used Ember to build my own, and demo what I can do with it."
